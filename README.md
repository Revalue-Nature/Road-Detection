# Road Detection Overview
This project focuses on the development of an advanced road detection system leveraging computer vision techniques. At the heart of our approach is a simple deep learning model based on the Residual-UNet architecture. This model serves as the baseline for our project, providing a robust starting point for further experimentation and enhancement. The primary goal is to develop a final model that builds upon the baseline, enhancing its capabilities through systematic experimentation. 

# Current Status and Future Directions
This repository is actively maintained and regularly updated as the project evolves. We welcome contributions and suggestions from the community as we strive to push the boundaries of what is possible in automated road detection using computer vision.
